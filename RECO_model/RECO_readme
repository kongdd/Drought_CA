##############################################

RECO 1.0 is an R-based semi-empirical model for estimating ecosystem respiration from MODIS data at the 1km and 8day scale. 
The model is parameterized and validated using FLUXNET data across North America and Europe. It is currently applicable to all major biomes, except the wet tropics.
For further details, please refer to:

R scripts are developed for MPI application; please adopt scripts to local environment and directories.

### Climate Classification ###
Koeppen-Geiger climate classification is provided resampled and disaggregated to MODIS tiles

### MODIS landcover ###
MODIS IGBP landcover classification is resampled and provided in MODIS tiles 

### the following MODIS inputs need to be prepared ###

1. nighttime LST (LSTnight)
2. LST day-night difference (LSTdif)
3. standard EVI (EVI)
4. mean EVI in Tref window (EVImean_Tref)
5. mean EVI (EVImean)
6. normalized snow index (NDSI)
7. mean nighttime LST (LSTnightmean)
4. mean daytime LST (LSTmean)

### run following script sequence in order to download, reproject, and prepare inputs, run the RECO model and resample and mosaic output files ###

### download and reproject							### Comment
1. /scripts/download_and_reproject/write_url_for_downloading.R			produces file with url addresses to download from
2. /scripts/download_and_reproject/download_MODIS_from_URL.R			downloads MODIS tiles in HDF format
3. /scripts/download_and_reproject/reproject_and_hdf_to_tif.R			reprojection script, needs MODIS Reprojection Tool (MRT) to be installed
4. /scripts/download_and_reproject/prepare_input_maps.R			quality assessment, gap-filling, etc. run individually for EVI, LST, and LC; produces EVI, NDSI, LSTdif, LSTnight, and landcover

### prepare inputs
5. /scripts/prepare_inputs/calculate_meanLST_n.R				produces mean nighttime LST tiffs	
6. /scripts/prepare_inputs/calculate_meanLST_d.R				produces mean daytime LST tiffs
7. /scripts/prepare_inputs/calculate_meanEVI.R					produces mean EVI
8. /scripts/prepare_inputs/calculate_meanEVI_Tref.R				produces mean EVI in Tref window
9. /scripts/prepare_inputs/clip_and_resample_koppengeiger_world_map.R		clips and resamples koppen-geiger world map to match MODIS tiles

### run RECO
10. /scripts/run_model/Rref_and_Rstd_calculation.R				calculates Reco for prepared tiles and dates, output geotiff

### post production
11. /scripts/post_production/monthly_average.R					produces monthly averages of Reco tiles
12. /scripts/post_production/annual_sum.R					produces annual sums with gap-filling 
13. /scripts/post_production/resample_reco_tiles_to_match_mosaic.R		crop and resample reco 1km tiles to produce high resolution 1km map
14. /scripts/post_production/resample_and_mosaic_reco_to_0.5°_grid.R		resamples and mosaics Reco tiles to 0.5° map
