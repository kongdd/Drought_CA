## Objectives


  - 1 What are the spatial and temporal dynamics of the current drought?
  
  - 2 How much has the carbon sink strength been reduced by the current drought?
  
  - 3 Are natural systems more resilient than agricultural systems to drought?
  
  - 4 What are the impacts of drought on ecosystem services?
  

## 1 What are the spatial and temporal dynamics of the current drought?

 - How bad is the current drought?
 
 - Data: [scPDSI](http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/monitor/WWDT/current.php?folder=scpdsi)
 
 - Data: [workflow](http://github.com/macroecology/Drought_CA/blob/master/pdsi/workflow_diagram/pdsi_workflow.jpg)


## 2 How much has the carbon sink strength been reduced by the current drought?

Data:
 - Amareiflux Data (NEE, GEE, Reco)
 - Modis (EVI, LST)

Objective: Examine changes in CO2 sequestration (NEE) for the entire state of CA and determine how drought impacts CO2 dynamics in natural and agricultural ecosystems

## Reco estimation validate Modis derived GPP

## 3 Are natural systems more resilient than agricultural systems to drought?

  - Modis derived NPP,
  - Rainfall (PRISM),
  - CROP map (cdl)
  - Objectives: Comparing (map) resilience (differences in Cg/rain mm) in natural and Agricultural systems 

## 4 What are the impacts of drought on ecosystem services?
  - Carbon sink?
  - Crop yield?
  - Water?

## thank you very much!
