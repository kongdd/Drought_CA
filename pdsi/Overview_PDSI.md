#### Some analysis of PDSI 

In this file I show you some of the tasks that we've done with the PDSI.

 - Overview of the [workflow](https://github.com/macroecology/Drought_CA/blob/master/pdsi/workflow_diagram/pdsi_workflow.jpg)
 - [Temporal evolution of PDSI](https://github.com/macroecology/Drought_CA/blob/master/pdsi/monthly/scpdsi.md) for CA from 1896 to 2014 monthly. 
 - Exploration of the worst months of the whole time serie ([how bad is bad?](https://github.com/macroecology/Drought_CA/blob/master/pdsi/how_bad/HowBadisBadplot.md)). 
 - Animation video: we have created several videos about Drought in US and California: 
	 -  Monthly evolution of the scPDSI for CA state: 
		 - **version 2** ([video](https://vimeo.com/104330415)) 
		 - version 1 (old) ([video](https://vimeo.com/102880074)) 
	 -  Monthly evolution of the scPDSI for US state: 
		 - **version 1** ([video](https://vimeo.com/104330414)) 
	To create this videos we downloaded raster data of scPDSI for US ([script](https://github.com/macroecology/Drought_CA/blob/master/pdsi/stpdsi/downloadPDSIraster.md) to download data) and then we created the videos for US ([script](https://github.com/macroecology/Drought_CA/blob/master/pdsi/stpdsi/generateAnimationUS.md)) and for CA ([script](https://github.com/macroecology/Drought_CA/blob/master/pdsi/stpdsi/generateAnimationCA.md)).
